# Building a website with Node.js and Express

This repository is built off of the linkedin learning course 'Building Dynamic Websites with Node.js and Express' by Daniel Khan on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/daniel-khan).

I have decided to continue developing this website as personal practice with front end development.

## Setting up the project
